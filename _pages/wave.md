# Why We Need a New Model  

Assessing how global economic shocks spread across countries and sectors requires tools that capture both behavioural responses and structural interdependencies. Trade models estimate welfare changes using substitution elasticities, but these are often externally calibrated and rely on restrictive assumptions about homothetic and linear preferences. They tell us how trade flows might reallocate but not how these shifts propagate through domestic and international production networks.

MRIO and IO models, by contrast, excel at describing supply-chain propagation, but assume fixed technical coefficients and no behavioural substitution. They show how production responds mechanically to shocks, but not how consumers and firms alter demand when prices change.

Together, these limitations motivate the development of the **Welfare and Value Added Elasticities (WAVE)** model, which integrates flexible demand estimation with structural production linkages to deliver a coherent and empirically grounded welfare analysis.



# What the WAVE Model Does  



The WAVE model combines a Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS), estimated using reshaped MRIO expenditure and price data in {% cite naqvi2025a %} with the *Asian Development Bank's Multi-Regional Input–Output (ADB MRIO)* framework used in {% cite naqvi2025b %}. This integration allows WAVE to estimate behavioural demand responses to shocks and trace them through global value chains to quantify changes in Value Added (VA), a welfare-relevant metric aligned with GDP.

The WAVE model integrates behavioural demand elasticities with global production networks by linking three conceptual stages illustrated in the figure. The left panel shows the baseline Multi-Regional Input–Output (MRIO) system, consisting of three key components:

1. $ 𝑍^0 $, the intermediate transactions matrix, which captures how sectors across countries supply inputs to one another;
2. $ 𝑌^0 $, the final demand vector, which includes household, government, and investment expenditure; and
3. $ 𝑋^0 $, the resulting total output vector, determined by production technologies and final demand. Value added is shown as the orange block beneath the IO structure, representing primary factor income generated by each sector.

The centre panel represents the behavioural adjustment stage upon which WAVE is built. Using the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) elasticities derived in Naqvi 2025a, WAVE takes an external shock—such as a tariff, price change, or income shift—and computes how final demand reallocates across global supplying regions. This step isolates the region-by-region consumer substitution response, transforming the baseline final demand vector $ 𝑌^0 $ into a post-shock allocation that reflects empirically estimated price and income sensitivities. The figure highlights that the adjustment occurs at the final demand interface, where the link between country–sector outputs and global consumer markets is located.

The right panel shows the full MRIO propagation of these behavioural changes. Once the final demand vector is updated to $ Y^1 $, the MRIO framework recomputes intermediate demands $ Z^1 $ and total output $ X^1 $ through the global input–output structure. Because sectors depend on one another for intermediate inputs, even small changes in $ Y^1 $ generate cascading effects throughout the production network. These propagate both domestically and internationally, ultimately yielding a new vector of value added (shown again in orange). This process captures how behavioural changes in consumption translate into changes in global production, employment, and income.



# What makes WAVE different  

WAVE differs fundamentally from traditional trade or IO models in several ways. First, it relies on empirically estimated elasticities derived directly from MRIO data rather than stylised parameters. This approach captures regional substitution patterns and non-linear income effects more realistically, especially via the QUAIDS specification of {% cite naqvi2025a %}.

Second, by embedding these elasticities within the MRIO system, WAVE models the entire pass-through of shocks, from consumer substitution to global supply-chain propagation, offering a richer picture than either approach can provide alone.

Third, the framework evaluates impacts in value added, not output, ensuring a direct welfare interpretation and producing results aligned with national accounts.

Together, these features make WAVE a transparent, empirically grounded, and versatile analytical framework.


# What WAVE can be used for  

Although initially applied to tariff shocks, the WAVE framework has much broader potential. It can evaluate:

- **Trade policies** such as tariffs, quotas, reshoring, and supply-chain diversification.
- **Climate and energy shocks**, including carbon border adjustments and fossil-fuel price changes.
- **Disaster and resilience scenarios**, where supply constraints interact with behavioural adjustments.
- **Macroeconomic transitions**, including global demand shifts and structural realignments.

WAVE's combination of behavioural responses and structural interdependence allows analysts to quantify which sectors and countries are most vulnerable, how shocks propagate, and where resilience can be strengthened.


# What we learn from the 2025 USA Tariffs

{% cite naqvi2025b %} applies the WAVE model to the U.S. tariffs introduced in September 2025. The analysis shows that global value added falls by roughly 0.52 percent, with indirect effects about twice as large as direct ones. Direct losses occur mainly in traded manufacturing—such as textiles, chemicals, and machinery—while the majority of global losses come from indirect contractions in services, including transport, telecommunications, finance, and public administration.

The figure above shows the results of {% cite naqvi2025b %}, which decomposes the change in value added for every country in the data into direct effects, indirect effects, and the resulting net impact. The orange bars represent direct effects arising from reduced demand for targeted bilateral trade flows, while the turquoise bars capture the much larger, economy-wide indirect consequences that emerge as these demand shifts propagate through global supply chains. The open circles denote the overall net effect—highlighting that, for most countries, indirect propagation dominates the total outcome.

Several patterns stand out. First, direct effects are consistently small, typically between –0.1% and –0.5% across most economies. These changes reflect the immediate response of traded manufacturing sectors—machinery, chemicals, textiles, and related industries—to the U.S. tariff increases. By themselves, these impacts would suggest only a modest global disruption.

The indirect effects, however, tell a very different story. For many economies, the turquoise bars extend far below the direct component, revealing how production linkages amplify and redistribute the shock. For example, India (IND) and Pakistan (PAK) experience value-added declines of approximately –5.85% and –3.02%, respectively—almost entirely driven by indirect effects originating from global supply-chain contractions. Smaller but highly open economies such as Ireland (IRL) and Mexico (MEX) also experience substantial indirect losses (around –1.7% to –2%), despite relatively limited direct exposure to U.S.–China tariff lines. The figure makes clear that countries deeply embedded in global value chains are the most vulnerable, not necessarily those directly targeted by policy measures.

The results for the United States and China further illustrate the systemic nature of the shock. The United States (USA)—the tariff-imposing country—shows one of the largest net losses in the entire distribution, approximately –3.17%. In the figure, this outcome is driven overwhelmingly by the indirect bar, highlighting how tariff-induced price increases feed back into domestic production networks, raising costs for intermediate goods, compressing real demand, and reducing value added across service and infrastructure sectors. Meanwhile, China (CHN) exhibits only a mild net effect (around –0.47%), with the figure showing a relatively small indirect response compared to other countries. China’s large domestic market and diversified supply structure dampen the propagation of the tariff shock, absorbing much of the initial disruption.

More broadly, the figure illustrates a key insight of the WAVE framework: global shocks manifest primarily through indirect, network-mediated channels rather than through the direct impact of bilateral policy measures. For nearly every country shown, the turquoise bar (indirect pathway) contributes the majority of total value-added loss, often several times larger than the direct component. This demonstrates that understanding the consequences of trade policy requires modelling not just the targeted flows but the entire structure of global production and demand interdependence.




# The way forward  

The WAVE model introduced in {% cite naqvi2025a %} and {% cite naqvi2025b %} provides a foundation for a broad research agenda. Incorporating investment dynamics would enable long-term growth analysis. Adding employment coefficients would support labour-market modelling. Linking environmental satellite accounts would allow analysts to examine emissions, resource use, and sustainability transitions.

As global disruptions become more frequent and complex, WAVE offers a scalable, empirically grounded platform for understanding how shocks propagate, who is most affected, and where resilience can be strengthened within global value chains.
