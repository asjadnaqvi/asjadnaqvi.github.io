Welcome to my personal website. I am currently based in Vienna, Austria where I am working as a Senior Economist at the [Austrian Institute for Economic Research (WIFO)](https://www.wifo.ac.at), as an Assistant Professor at the [Institute for Ecological Economics](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/ecolecon/institute), Department of Socioeconomics, Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU), and as a Researcher Scholar, in the [Advancing Systems Analysis (ASA)](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/asa.html) program at the [International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)](https://iiasa.ac.at). From 2011-2013, I was the Research Director at the [Center for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP)](https://www.cerp.org.pk). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [New School for Social Research (New York)](https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/) (2007-2012) and my habilitation in Economics in 2020. Prior to 2007, I was based at the [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk) working on various research projects.

Currently, I am interested in exploring topics of environment inequality, cascading impact of climate shocks, climate finance, and North-South interactions. I work with macroeconomic models, agent-based models, and causal inference (DiDs, RDDs). I am always coding in Stata, Mathematica, and NetLogo. I also regularly blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide) and actively post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AsjadNaqvi).
