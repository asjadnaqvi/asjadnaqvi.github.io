Welcome to my personal website. I am currently based in Vienna, Austria where I am working as a Senior Economist at the [Austrian Institute for Economic Research (WIFO)](https://www.wifo.ac.at), and as an Assistant Professor at the [Institute for Ecological Economics](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/ecolecon/institute), Department of Socioeconomics, Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU). From 2011-2013, I was the Research Director at the [Center for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP)](https://www.cerp.org.pk). I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the [New School for Social Research (New York)](https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/) (2007-2012) and my Habilitation in Economics in 2020. Prior to 2007, I was based at the [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk) working on various research projects.

My current research work is at the intersection of developing climate models, diagnostic tools, decision support tools, climate analytics, and data science. I have worked on topics of climate-finance interactions, climate change, cascading impact of climate shocks, input-output relationships, and .distributional impacts. I work with macroeconomic models, agent-based models, and have a deep interest in development of causal inference methods and their application to climate-related problems. I code extensively in Stata and Mathematica and have good knowledge of several softwares. I regularly blog data science topics on [Medium](https://medium.com/the-stata-guide) and actively post on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/AsjadNaqvi).
