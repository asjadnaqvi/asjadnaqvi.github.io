I am a Senior Economist at the [Austrian Institute for Economic Research (WIFO)](https://www.wifo.ac.at) where my research explore the intersection of climate change, macroeconomic modeling, data analytics, international finance, and trade. With a career spanning nearly two decades, I have gained a wealth of experience at leading institutions, including the [Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU)](https://www.wu.ac.at/), the [International Institute for Applied System Analysis (IIASA)](https://iiasa.ac.at/), the [Center for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP)](https://www.cerp.org.pk), and the the [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/). In addition, I frequently collaborate with the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org) as a consultant, providing expertise on projects that explore the relationships between climate change, finance, debt, trade, and nature.


I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the [New School for Social Research (New York)](https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/) (2007-2012) and completed my Habilitation in Economics at the WU in 2020.
