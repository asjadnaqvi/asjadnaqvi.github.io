I am a Senior Economist at the [Austrian Institute for Economic Research (WIFO)](https://www.wifo.ac.at), specializing in innovative climate diagnostics and analytics aimed at supporting evidence-based decision-making. My career, spanning over two decades, has been shaped by diverse experiences at prominent institutions, including the [Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU)](https://www.wu.ac.at/), the [International Institute for Applied System Analysis (IIASA)](https://iiasa.ac.at/), the [Center for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP)](https://www.cerp.org.pk), and the the [Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)](https://lums.edu.pk/). I also work as a Consultant for the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org), contributing my expertise on climate economics and data analytics.

My research covers a wide range of topics, with a current focus on developing tools to analyze the intersection of climate change, macroeconomic developments, international finance, and trade.

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the [New School for Social Research (New York)](https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/) (2007-2012) and completed my Habilitation in Economics at WU in 2020.
