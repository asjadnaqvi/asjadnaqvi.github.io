I am a Senior Economist at the [Austrian Institute for Economic Research (WIFO)](https://www.wifo.ac.at) where my work focuses on climate change impacts, finance, and trade using tools such as demand system analysis, macroeconomic models, and causal analysis.

I also regularly collaborate with the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org).
