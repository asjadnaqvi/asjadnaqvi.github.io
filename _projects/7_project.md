**Project partners**: International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Internal Displacement Monitoring Cell (IDMC, Geneva)

**Funder**: USAID-OFDA

**Duration**: 2017-2018

**Role**: Develop various modeling frameworks for understanding displacement risk. My role was to build a multi-layer agent-based model to look at how catastrophic shocks result in displacement and supply-chain disruptions that can further amplify the impact of the shock.
