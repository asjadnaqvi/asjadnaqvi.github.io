**Duration**: 2018-2019

**Role**: Develop an agent-based model to simulate the distrbutional impacts of mobility credit trading. In the simulation, agents are endowed with mobility credits, based on their transport requirements. The agents are allowed to trade credits with each other based on their willingness to pay and demand and supply requrements. The simulation results show that richer agents with higher mobility requirements can afford to buy more credits while simultaneously redistributing some of their wealth to poorer households.
