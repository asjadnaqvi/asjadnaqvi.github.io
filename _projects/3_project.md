**Duration**: 2019-2021


**Background**

*Objectives*

* To identify environmental and socioeconomic effects of SAEVs, as wells as synergies and trade-offs between them.

* To extend an agent-based model (ABM) of Vienna’s transport system with a module that allows for the simulation of scenarios related to SAEVs.

* To support the formation of transport policies that lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions, while maintaining an efficient and inclusive transport system.

*Methods*

We use a large-scale multi-agent model that is able to represent the complex interactions between the transportation system, socioeconomic factors and environmental factors. The model is based on the MATSim, a standard research software to simulate mobility patterns for several large cities.
We simulate different scenarios that differ in their assumption concerning SAEV technology, SAEV market structure, consumer preferences, and policy interventions.

**Role**: Project partner and Work Package lead. My role is to coordinate with WU and AIT to develop various SAEV scenarios for the city of Vienna. Process and analyze the simualtion results, and work on papers that explore the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of introducing SAEVs in the city of Vienna.
