Increasingly, research shows that the most severe impacts arise not only from the immediate damage, but from how people and firms respond in the days, weeks, and months that follow. These behavioral adjustments—how households cope with income losses, how firms reorient trade, and how migration patterns shift—can generate ripple effects that extend far beyond the disaster zone.</p> <p>To capture these dynamics, this research introduces <strong>SHELScape</strong>, a spatially explicit, multi-layer agent-based model (ABM) designed to simulate how climate- and disaster-related shocks cascade through interconnected socioeconomic systems. SHELScape brings together insights from food trade networks, disaster-driven migration, and multi-layer risk modeling, synthesizing them into a unified analytical framework.</p> <h2 id="why-agent-based-models">Why Agent-Based Models?</h2> <p>Physical shocks propagate through economic systems under conditions of <strong>high uncertainty</strong>, <strong>limited data</strong>, and <strong>severe time constraints for policy response</strong>.

At that point, ABM were in their infancy and climate impacts on economic systems was not a major topic of research. There were also computational limitations and access to software, that would allow the development of multi-agent systems with complex interactions, was limited. If one was doing Markov chains-type analysis, then MATLAB was the way to go (R was too new back then). Mathematica was there, but despite being a super powerful software, it was (or is) not the easiest program to use. My supervisor <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/faculty/duncan-foley/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Duncan Foley</a> did use it extensively for his own models. So my decision was to go with <a href="https://www.netlogo.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NetLogo</a>, an open-source project from Northwestern University’s <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling (CCL)</a>. NetLogo is based on Logo, a program that has turtles, and we can give turtles instructions to move in an intuitive way, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ask turtle 0 [fd 1]</code>, which would make Turle 0 move forward one step on the screen. This visual element made NetLogo appealing and relatively easier to use but there were some challenges along the way. On a side note, similar Logo-type logic also exists in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Scratch</a>, an open-source software from MIT taught to kids in school these days (and also a fun language to explore).</p> <p>There are two challenges with developing a spatially-explicit micro-founded Agent-Based Model (ABM). First are decisions to move around a pre-defined space, and second to make behvioral decisions that among other things, also involve moving around the canvas. Agents can “own” variables (or asset stocks) such as labor, money, food etc that can be intialized based on some distribution, and these can evolve depending on interactions with the (a) environment and (b) with other agents. Since SHELScape is an economic model, the behavior needs to come from economic literature on agents make decisions. So two parallel developments took place during the development of the model; (a) learn and master NetLogo especially on how agents move around, and store decisions in a complex array of nested lists, and (b) find the relevant socioeconomic literature on how agents deal with shocks. This opened up a rabbit hole of diving deeper into the literature on decision-making under uncertainity, evidence on income and consumption smoothing, permanent income hypothesis, etc. On the programming side there was another challenge; since agents exist at specific locations that form their own micro cosmos of economic interactions, a change of location would alter the behivior as agents get added and subtracted. But changing locations is a complex process which also implies physically moving from one location to another along links of varying lengths (or road networks) that can get destroyed. At that point, pathing routines did not exist in NetLogo. As a result, countless hours went into learning about Djikstra and A-Star algorithms. Even though I abandoned this micro agent-level focus later (for various reasons we will discuss below), I did manage to implement the Djikstra algorithm, which was its own reward. Later versions of NetLogo did incorporate shortest-distance routines with the additional of the network (nw) extension, but I had already built a flexible path-finding function that could minimize travel time based on distances (link lengths) or hops (fewest node changes), and could be combined with different probability weights (income, distance, community at destination etc.) for running different scenarios.</p> <p>The first version of the model (v1.0 2008-2012) led to my first publication in 2014 in the Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination (JEIC) <a class="citation" href="#NaqviRehm2014">(Naqvi &amp; Rehm, 2014)</a>. The paper looked at 2010 flooding impact in Pakistan and modeled displacement of populations and markets adjustments. In 2012, during the Young Scientist Summer Program (YSSP) at IIASA, led to the development of the second version of SHELscape (v2.0 2012-2021) that was considerably more aggregate and more policy oriented. It was a meso-level upgrade to the first version where the uncessary routines of micro agent decisions, including traveling and movements along paths were taken out. Instead, nodes (or locations) would sending flows of people and goods based that would arrive based on distances and their relative distances. This version also had a stronger focus on better market mechanisms, better implementation of probabilitic decision making, and ring-fencing of spatial extents to make the model computationally faster (other if all locations are being evaluated, then we would have a O(N^2) explosion). SHELScape 2.0, led to several publications; World Development in 2017, that explored 2008 post-earthquake in northern Pakistan <a class="citation" href="#Naqvi2017b">(Naqvi, 2017)</a>, 2020 paper on bread-basket failures in India using Copulas <a class="citation" href="#Naqvi2020">(Naqvi et al., 2020)</a>, and the 2021 paper in Nature Scientific Reports, that contextualized the model framework, and introduced <em>VRank</em>, a multi-layer indicator for synthesizing the complexity of different market adjustments <a class="citation" href="#Naqvi2021b">(Naqvi &amp; Monasterolo, 2021)</a>.</p> <h2 id="funding-and-support">Funding and support</h2> <p>The model evolved over a long time horizon and variations of it have been part of several projects.

While the direct impacts of natural disasters are well understood, the channels through which these shocks spread to non-affected regions, still represents an open research question. In this paper we propose modelling socioeconomic systems as spatially-explicit, multi-layer behavioral networks, where the interplay of supply-side production, and demand-side consumption decisions, can help us understand how climate shocks cascade. We apply this modelling framework to analyze the spatial-temporal evolution of vulnerability following a negative food-production shock in one part of an agriculture-dependent economy. Simulation results show that vulnerability is cyclical, and its distribution critically depends on the network density and distance from the epicenter of the shock. We also introduce a new multi-layer measure, the Vulnerability Rank ( VRank ), which synthesizes various location-level risks into a single index. This framework can help design policies, aimed to better understand, effectively respond, and build resilience to natural disasters. This is particularly important for poorer regions, where response time is critical and financial resources are limited.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Naqvi2021b</span><span class="p">,</span>

However, sparse research exists on the dependent nature of climate shocks on food-producing breadbasket regions and their subsequent cascading impacts. In this paper, we propose that a copula approach, combined with a multilayer network and an agent-based model, can give important insights on how tail-dependent shocks can impact food systems. We show how such shocks can potentially cascade within a region through the behavioral interactions of various layers. Based on our suggested framework, we set up a model for India and show that risks due to drought events multiply if tail dependencies during extremes drought is explicitly taken into account. We further demonstrate that the risk is exacerbated if displacement also takes place. In order to quantify the spatial–temporal evolution of climate risks, we introduce a new measure of multilayer vulnerability that we term Vulnerability Rank or VRank . We find that with higher food production losses, the number of agents that are affected increases nonlinearly due to cascading effects in different network layers. These effects spread to the unaffected regions via large-scale displacement causing sudden changes in production, employment and consumption decisions. Thus, demand shifts also force supply-side adjustments of food networks in the months following the climate shock. We suggest that our framework can provide a more accurate picture of food security-related systemic risks caused by multiple breadbasket failures which, in turn, can better inform risk management and humanitarian aid strategies.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Naqvi2020</span><span class="p">,</span>

In a spatial environment, with multiple locations with independent but inter-connected markets, these transitions quickly become complex and highly non-linear due to the feedback loops between the micro individual-level decisions and the meso location-wise market decisions. To capture these continuously evolving micro-meso interactions, this paper presents a spatially explicit bottom-up agent-based model to analyze natural disaster-like shocks to low-income regions. The aim of the model is to temporally and spatially track how population distributions, income, and consumption levels evolve, in order to identify low-income workers that are “food insecure”. The model is applied to the 2005 earthquake in northern Pakistan, which faced catastrophic losses and high levels of displacement in a short time span, and with market disruptions, resulted in high levels of food insecurity. The model is calibrated to pre-crisis trends, and shocked using distance-based output and labor loss functions to replicate the earthquake impact. Model results show, how various factors like existing income and saving levels, distance from the fault line, and connectivity to other locations, can give insights into the spatial and temporal emergence of vulnerabilities. The simulation framework presented here, leaps beyond existing modeling efforts, which usually deals with macro long-term loss estimates, and allows policy makers to come up with informed short-term policies in an environment where data is non-existent, policy response is time dependent, and resources are limited.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">Naqvi2017b</span><span class="p">,</span>

Key features of the model include the integration of decentralized markets into a full economy in a spatially explicit way and the analysis of short-run adjustment processes. The model is calibrated to a low income region of rural agrarian Pakistan that faced severe floods in 2010. Dynamic adaptation by agents in response to falling income includes migrating and running down savings. Despite these consumption smoothing strategies, some low income groups are vulnerable to starvation. The paper showcases two hypothetical policy scenarios, a cash and a food transfer program, and tracks their effects on the welfare of low income groups in the economy.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">NaqviRehm2014</span><span class="p">,</span>
